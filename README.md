The Oracle APEX (Oracle Application Express) is a low-code development platform that allows developers to create web-based applications using only a web browser. It's a web-based tool that requires an Oracle database and can be used to create a wide range of applications, from simple data entry forms to complex web applications with interactive reports and charts.

I believe the future of software development is "low code" and my Oracle Apex repository contains personal projects which I have completed experimenting with the platform.
